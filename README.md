# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard
# My Weather App 


## Description

```
When you open the page you are presented with a "weather dashboard" Header.

On the left side of the page is a search box for city input. 

When you enter a city and click search, you are presented with the weather for the day and a 5-day forecast. 

The current day's weather and the five-day forecast display the date with the day of the week, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and an icon representing the weather condition. 

The current day's weather also includes the city name you searched for. 

The city you search for saves in your search history in the form of a button.

When you click on it, you'll receive the current weather and the 5-day forecast.   

If you search for an unknown city you are presented with a message to try again.
